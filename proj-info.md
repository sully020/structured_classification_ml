# ML Classifications - C. Sullivan
## Apache License V2.0

This repository is a single-developer project owned by Christopher Sullivan of Western New England University, and licensed under the Apache License V2.0. The goal of this project is to classify two datasets: e-mails categorized by spam or not spam, and patients classified by diabetes test results (+/-) using the Supervised Machine Learning techniques of: 
1. Decision Trees
2. Neural Networks
3. Random Forest Bagging
4. k-Nearest Neighbor

Using these techniques, I compare accuracy scores and training times over cross-validation runs to see which learning techniques are the most robust against varied datasets.
